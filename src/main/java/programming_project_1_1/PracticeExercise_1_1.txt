You want to decide whether you should drive your car to work or take the train.
You know the one-way distance from your home to your place of work, and the fuel efficiency 
of your car (in miles per gallon). You also know the one-way price of a train ticket. 
You assume the cost of gas at $4 per gallon, and car maintenance at 5 cents per mile. 
Write an algorithm to decide which commute is cheaper.

Your answer in pseudocode below:

Create a variable for the distance to work
Create a variable for the amount of gallons used per mile.
Create a variable for train ticket.
Set gas_price to 4.
Set car_maintenance to 0.05.
Calculate the one-way cost of driving the car to work:
If car_cost is less than train_price, print "Drive to work"
If car_cost is greater than or equal to train_price, print "Take the train"
